# 🔢 Building an ML Model for digit recognition 

🤖 In this project, we have created an ML model that uses CNN classification algorithm to read digits and identify them. We have worked upon a standard MNIST dataset of thousands of digits. By using this dataset, we have trained, tested and validated our model.

We have tested various algorithms and compared their accuracy, precision, F1 score and recall to generate the most effective model.

📊 Here are the comparisons of various metrics and other relevant plots:

Through this project we got to learn a lot about Machine Learning and AI Models, we trained our model on large data sets, implemented their splitting and formulated an organised and effective code.


💻 The tech stack we used:

1. Python
2. Libraries: matplotlib, pandas, keras, scikit, TensorFlow etc.
3. Classification algorithms: CNN, Randon Forest,SVM, KNN, DBN, MLP. 
4. Google Collab


🖋 END NOTE:
During the course of this project, we got to comprehend various research articles which supplemented us in writing an optimised code and intricately understanding the mechanism of machine learning.
